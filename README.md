# PlayersEvaluationApp

The main purpose of this app is to help with tracking and evaluating performance of members from your raid group in World of Warcraft. 
For example: You start the app and register (pretty basic stuff). 
After that you are now able to create your own roster by selecting "Create roster" button and start adding players to it. 
There will be simple and intuitive user interface for that.
After completing tonight's raid, you can log-in to the app, select your roster from menu and load it, 
then you can click on auto-assign points button in order to give for example +10 points to every raider who participated in this event
and if there was one shining star in your group you can select him seperatly and add a few more points or substract if performed poorly. :)

I decided to build a restful api and wpf client app, because I wanted to have integrated and comperable data between users.
I know that I could make this much simpler but I treat this as an excersise in the first place. This is my learning project after all. :)
